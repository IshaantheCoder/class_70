    <p>I loved the movie a lot 
      As I am great fan of marvel
      Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbounding and surely an 
      enthralling experience. The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't 
      disappoint. Watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel 
      has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn 
      sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and 
      Joe Russo, have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher 
      Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable
       moments. The film has a great balance of humour, emotions and action. The biggest 
       strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have 
       ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climatic battle 
       left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. 
       The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humour doesn't look 
       exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive
        and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU
         films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me 
         goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes 
         to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays 
         the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no 
         one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.</p>
